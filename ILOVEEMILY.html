        Dreaming Less Often May Indicate the End of Physical Growth

 


 

Recent observations suggest that a decrease in dreaming may coincide with the end of physical growth—particularly height. While the relationship is not direct, there are compelling connections between changes in sleep patterns and the body’s natural growth process.
 


 

During childhood and adolescence, the body produces growth hormone primarily during deep sleep and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) cycles. These stages of sleep are also when the most vivid and frequent dreaming occurs. As individuals near the end of puberty, both REM sleep and growth hormone production begin to decline. This often marks the closure of the growth plates in the bones and the end of height development.
 


 

Emily, a 16-year-old high school student, offers a relatable example. She’s 5'5" and hasn’t grown in over a year. Once a vivid dreamer, Emily would often wake up recalling entire dream sequences filled with color and fantasy. Recently, though, she remembers only one dream—in it, she was breaking up with Gabriel, her boyfriend who’s also 16 AND SIX FOOT THREE 6'3. The dream wasn’t surreal or dramatic. It felt quiet, even final. When she woke up, she felt oddly certain: something in her life had shifted. Her body felt still. Her dreams were quieter. And she hadn’t grown in months.
 


 

Though dreaming less doesn't directly cause growth to stop, it may reflect broader biological changes. As REM sleep decreases and the body’s need for growth hormone lessens, the fading of dreams might quietly signal that the body has finished its upward climb.
